                    Voyager, the 5-piece burst into the UK metal scene with technical riffs, big orchestral soundscapes
                    and soaring vocals, with what they call ‘cinematic djent’.</p>

                    Townsend and more, Vanitas debuted in Feb 2022 with their epic single ‘Ghostly Coast’. Vanitas began
                    making waves across the UK scene with a reputation for exuberant live performances “Within moments,
                    I was blown away by the level of performance given by the act both musically and visually.The band
                    relentlessly gave their all in one of the tightest performances I’ve had the pleasure of watching
                    from a new project in an incredibly long time.” (Rock N Load).</p>
